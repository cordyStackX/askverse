# AskVerse

**Wallet-connected Q&A platform where good answers get gifted, not just liked.**

AskVerse lets communities ask questions, share answers, and reward the most helpful responses with real XLM — turning knowledge-sharing into something tangible. Built for the APAC Stellar Hackathon under the **Payment & Consumer Applications** track.

## Focus Area: Payment & Consumer Applications

AskVerse is a consumer-facing payment tool disguised as a Q&A app. The core loop — ask, answer, gift, rank — turns Stellar's fast, low-fee rails into an everyday reward mechanism anyone can use without needing to understand blockchain first. A user connects a wallet, browses questions like they would on any forum, and can tip a helpful answer in XLM in a couple of taps. That's the accessible, real-world payment experience this track calls for.

## The Problem

Good answers online routinely go unrewarded. Upvotes and hearts feel good but carry no real value, so there's little incentive for people to share deep, useful knowledge — especially in communities (students, local business owners, hobbyists) where expertise is often given away for free. AskVerse closes that gap by letting anyone reward useful answers with a real XLM gift, instantly and without a payment processor in between.

## How It Works

1. **Ask** — post a question with a title and detailed body.
2. **Answer** — community members respond.
3. **Heart** — react to posts you find useful.
4. **Gift** — send XLM directly to an answer that helped you.
5. **Rank** — the leaderboard tracks total gifted score, surfacing the most valuable contributors.

Rewards aren't auto-minted — they're peer-funded. The leaderboard reflects real value transferred, not just popularity.

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Tech |
|---|---|
| Framework | Next.js 16, React 19, TypeScript |
| Styling | CSS Modules |
| Data | Supabase |
| State/Data-fetching | TanStack Query |
| Wallet / Chain Abstraction | [Cordy Minikit](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@cordystackx/cordy_minikit) (CordyStackX) |
| Stellar | Testnet, Horizon API |
| EVM | Base Sepolia |

## Architecture

    A -->|CRUD| D["Supabase<br/>questions · answers · hearts<br/>gifts · profiles · leaderboard"]
```

Cordy Minikit handles wallet connection and Stellar payment calls to Horizon; Supabase stores app state (posts, gift records, leaderboard scores) and keeps score reconciliation off-chain for speed, while the actual value transfer happens on-chain via XLM.
